# 11 Online Blocks

These are blocks meant for developers to quickly build a Gutenberg site to match the branding guidelines of a client. The idea is to take away the plethora of choices that come with the standard Gutenberg blocks and provide a blank slate so any person can make posts and pages that match the branding guidelines.

We'll also be adding more blocks that are useful for most site builds.

## `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the blocks in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in the code.

##  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for the blocks inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.
